# Overview
Boilerplate code to develop React apps with parcel-bundler. Minimal babel configrations, only presets are used without any plugins. The babel configrations should work with all javascript versions, if any new javascript syntax doesn't seem to work, please check browser support and babel support and update the babel dependencies
## What's Included
- React Context API implementation
- Async and Await

> Note : The application calls a dummy api [JSONPlaceholder]([https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)) which is not maintained by me. It's there only to demonstrate async/await.
